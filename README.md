## Overview
This project provides a data-driven analysis of the 2024 Indian General Election Results, transforming a raw dataset into a strategic business intelligence tool. It uses SQL for data preparation, aggregation, and joining multiple tables, and Power BI for interactive visualization. The dashboards enable multi-level analysis of election outcomes, allowing stakeholders to explore results at the national, state, and constituency levels and identify key trends in seat distribution and close contests. The solution demonstrates a replicable framework for turning large-scale electoral data into actionable insights for evidence-based political strategy.

## Problem Statement
During the 2024 Indian General Elections, a large volume of constituency- and candidate-level data was collected. However, the data was scattered, unstructured, and difficult to analyze, making it challenging for political analysts and strategists to quickly extract key insights, such as seat distribution, close contests, and party performance. This is a significant problem because campaigns must use their time, money, and resources efficiently, and confusing data can lead to poor strategic decisions.

To address this, this project uses a publicly available Kaggle dataset (CSV) and implements an end-to-end solution combining SQL and Power BI. The workflow involves data aggregation, and joining of multiple tables in SQL, followed by the creation of interactive dashboards, charts, and maps in Power BI. This approach allows decision-makers to explore election results at national, state, and constituency levels in a clear and intuitive way.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how a well-designed business intelligence platform can transform complex election data into actionable insights, enabling users to move from data chaos to strategic clarity and make informed, effective decisions.




## Dataset Details
The analysis is based on five core CSV files sourced from Kaggle(CSV), which form the basis of the data model.
- 	Constituencywise Details: Dimension table providing demographic and structural information for each constituency.
- 	Constituencywise Results: The primary fact table containing detailed, candidate-wise vote counts at the constituency level.
-	States: Dimension table containing details of all states and union territories.
-	Partywise Results: Summary table with aggregated election outcomes for each political party.
-	Statewise Results: Summary table with aggregated election outcomes at the state level.


## Tools & Technologies
-	SQL: Used SQL queries with functions like Window functions, CTEâ€™s, Joins, GROUP BY, ORDER BY to analyze election results
-	Power BI: Dashboards, DAX functions, Data Modeling, Drill-through, Bookmarks, Slicer, KPI cards, and Charts
- MS Word: Report Making

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
1.  Data Collection: Imported the 2024 Indian General Election dataset from a Kaggle(CSV) files.
2. Data Cleaning: removed blank spaces to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
3. Data Transformation: Aggregated raw data using SQL and Power Query, joined multiple tables to consolidate information, and created new calculated metrics such as Vote Share % and Winning Margin using DAX.
4. Data Modeling: Designed and implemented a Star Schema with a central fact table and multiple dimension tables to create efficient relationships for fast and accurate filtering.

## Dashboards
POWERBI Dashboard Shows:

-  Landing Page: Provides a high-level overview of national election results and key metrics.
- Overall Analysis: Summarizes seat distribution, vote shares, and alliance performance nationally.
- State Demographics Analysis: Highlights state-wise voting patterns, population insights, and demographic trends.
- Political Landscape by State: Visualizes alliance strongholds, seat dominance, and regional competition.
- Constituency-Level Analysis: Details battleground constituencies, turnout, and candidate performance.
- Details Grid View: Offers a tabular, drill-through view of all constituencies with export and filter options.
